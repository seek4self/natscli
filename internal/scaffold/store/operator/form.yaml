  Operator Managed NATS Server

  This will guide you through a series of question to create a NATS Server
  configuration managed by a NATS Operator. 
  
  To use this an Operator should have been created using the "nats auth" command.

  For more information about Decentralized Authentication please read:

    help: Each server needs a Unique name, by default this uses the FQDN but in JetStream scenarios it is worth setting stable names and adjusting DNS pointing at the right node.

      JetStream configuration
      
      We will now configure the NATS JetStream persistence layer. Setting the limits 
      to -1 means a dynamic value will be chosen by the server at start. We strongly 
      suggest setting specific limits.

      NATS Resolver Configuration
      
      We will now configure where the NATS Server will store account JWT files. 
      JWT files are pushed to the server using 'nats auth account push' and 
      describe the full configuration for each account.
      
      Every server in a cluster needs a resolver configuration.
